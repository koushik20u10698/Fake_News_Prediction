# Fake_News_Prediction    

Logistic regression is one of the simplest and widely used algorithms for binary classification tasks, such as detecting fake news (binary: fake or genuine). Here's how you can use logistic regression for fake news prediction:

Data Preparation: Gather a labeled dataset containing news articles labeled as either "fake" or "genuine." Preprocess the data by cleaning the text, removing stop words, and converting the text into numerical representations (e.g., using TF-IDF or word embeddings).

Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the preprocessed text data. These features could include word frequency, word presence/absence, sentiment scores, and other linguistic features that might be indicative of fake news.

Split the Data: Divide the dataset into a training set and a test set to evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model.

Model Training: Fit a logistic regression model to the training data. The model will learn the relationship between the input features and the binary target variable (fake or genuine).

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained logistic regression model on the test set using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC).

Fine-Tuning: Depending on the evaluation results, you can fine-tune hyperparameters or experiment with different feature engineering approaches to improve the model's performance.
